# WiHi

Using ReactJS as the frontend framework along with NodeJS and MySQL, I have started to create a simple website to join groups of users and figure out peopleâ€™s presence by shared network connection. A user would have to register for an account, then either find and request to be part of a user group or create their own and invite people. Each group will have various subnet domains associated with it and users in the same group can see if any other group members are connected to the same WiFi network. This could be useful in workplaces and offices to see if people are at the office or not. The user must be connected to the WiFi they are trying to find shared connections with. I have started on the authentication framework as well as the CRUD functionality but the WiFi sniffing and other details have yet to be implemented.
